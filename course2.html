			<p>The first assignment was our “Lived Experiences” paper, in which we had to identify our academic path and a piece technology that has influenced our decision. 
			I chose to write my paper on a hospital ventilator. This piece of technology has really played a big role in influencing my decision to go down the path of medicine. 
			The ventilator is important to me because I have had two major experiences with it. The first is when my cousin had cancer and he was placed on a ventilator to help 
			him breathe until his body was strong enough to do it on its own. My second experience was when I had heart surgery; I was placed on a ventilator during the five hour 
			procedure to make sure I keep breathing steadily. Ventilators are a very important piece of technology in a hospital. I really enjoyed doing the “Lived Experiences” project 
			because I am very passionate about the field I am going into and I have many experiences with the medical field that have influenced my decision.</p>
