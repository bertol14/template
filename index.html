		<h1>my portfolio</h1>
			<p> My name is Kelly Bertolini and I am currently and undergraduate at Michigan State University. I am a pre-medicine student and plan to take the path of the medical field.
		I play women's lacrosse here at MSU and I am a midfielder. Lacrosse is very important to me and I love playing it. My teammates mean the world to me and I know they 
		will always have my back. I took WRA 110 because I needed a writing class for a university requirement. Going into this class I really struggled with writing but now that
		I am finishing up the semester I believe that my skills and confidence have really been strengthened. I have a 6 month old puppy named Beatrice and she is my world.
