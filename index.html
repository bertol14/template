			<p>There are a few things that have really influenced why I chose the major I did and my career path. When I was much younger, my cousin was diagnosed with T-cell gamma delta lymphoma at the age of sixteen. This is a very deadly form of cell cancer. Within about six months, despite the plethora of doctor’s and their extreme efforts, my cousin Eric was sadly on his deathbed. With the help of my strong willed uncle and the doctors, they were able to get a special type of medicine from Austria approved for use on my cousin. The medicine slowly started to miraculously bring my cousin back to life. At the young age of 6 this experience ignited my passion to become that person who can create a miracle like this. So I decided that I wanted to pursue a degree in the medical field, specifically pediatric oncology. 
During this period while my cousin was fighting for his life, I became very interested in a machine that helped him breathe when he was not capable of doing so on his own. The ventilator was keeping him alive at his weakest times. Watching this piece of technology, that kept my dwindling cousin alive, was something truly amazing and made my interest in the medical field grow. Ventilators are very important assets for many different aspects of a hospital. A ventilator is a machine that blows air with extra oxygen into the airways and then down into the lungs of a victim. These amazing machines are used for many different things but their main functions are to keep very sick people alive and are used during surgeries and procedures to make sure the patient doesn’t stop breathing.
Another life changing experience that helped me decide on my future career was a surgery I had 2 years ago. I needed surgery because I had an extra electrical pathway in my heart. They used multiple different technologies during my surgery, they inserted three wires into my artery and then went up to my heart where they then took x-ray pictures that showed the wires inside my heart. Once they found the extra electrical pathway they then cauterized the spot it was coming from. The whole 5 hours that I was under general anesthesia I was on a ventilator that kept me breathing. Experiencing that made me appreciate that we have the technology like a ventilator to assist in so many different helpful things. This experience also made me realize that I, like the ventilators in my past life events, want to be helpful in the lives of so many people suffering from minor things to major deadly diseases such as cancer.
The ventilator was a key piece of technology that really helped me decide on a future career in medicine. This machine was mind blowing because I could not believe that something could have so much influence on the life of a person. More specifically, I want to become a Pediatric Oncologist. By my own definition, a Pediatric Oncologist is a doctor who takes care of children with cancer. From my past experience of witnessing my cousin fight a long hard battle and win against a deadly cancer made me realize that I wanted to help other young adults and children fight this nasty disease as well. I want to be specifically an oncologist because they interact and form relationships with their patients. I am very good with kids especially and forming relationships with children is one of my strong suits.
 In order to receive this degree I will have to work hard through thirteen long years of school. The first 4 years of schooling are for an undergraduate degree that will be aquired at Michigan State University. The next four years will be within a medical school, such as the program at Michigan State University. After that, I will continue to a three-year residency at a hospital, hopefully in New York, my ideal place to live. Finally, after that experience, I will continue at the hospital for 2 years to focus on a specialization, Pediatric Oncology. I am excited for this journey of the many years of schooling because I know the end result will be another successful person in the medical field who is capable of saving lives. There is nothing else I would rather do then be a doctor and help people so I am going to try my best and put my all into getting there.
Technology has become a very important part of all of our daily lives. Not only is modern technology prevalent in hospitals but it is found in just about every career. Technology is changing very rapid which is making things easier for the generations to come, along with it does come complications and set backs because the people using this modern technology wont have the skills to do things manually. The progressing of medical technology fascinates me. All this new technology has really influenced my decision to go to medical school and become a doctor. There is no other career that I am interested in so I am going to put my all into school and hopefully get to where I want to with my education. With the help of the new technology, the rate its progressing, and the way it has improved the medical field who knows what the future has to hold.
If my career path of pediatric oncology does not work out my back up option is to become a pediatric surgeon. Surgery is another part of the medical field that really interests me. There is a lot of modern technology used for surgery and one of the common things is the use of a ventilator. There are even robots designed to perform surgeries with little commands from a human, the way medical technology is progressing is mesmerizing. I have always had a passion for surgery but oncology is my first choice. The main difference between the two is when you work in oncology you see the same patients every day or every month for years and realistically you are going to lose a lot of patients. With surgery you see the patient maybe once or twice, fix them up and they are good to go. For both areas of the medical field the ventilator is very important and can save lives. They use a ventilator for surgery just to make sure the patient doesn’t stop breathing while the surgeon is operating. But a ventilator can be used at different extremes; a lot of the time ventilators are used to keep people who are brain dead alive to donate their organs. 
Technology was not the only thing that influenced my career path and choice of major. Between family experiences, my own experiences and learning of others experiences they have all really affected my decision to take the path toward becoming a doctor. Especially watching the doctors at Boston Children’s Hospital help my cousin fight for his life. Although it is not a technology, it is the main reason I have chosen this path and it has had the most influence on the classes I am taking in school and my major. All the influential experiences in my life and the modern technology has really helped me know for sure that the medical field is the place for me.
