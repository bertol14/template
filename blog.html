                <h>Entry 1</h>
                 <p>The purpose of the video was to express the pain that this man and his uncle felt because they were gay and the society they were part of were not accepting leading to the suicide of his unlce. the man then continues to say that he is his uncle, he is living the same life that his uncle lived.
                The video attempted to achieve its purpose by incorporating personal examples and experiences along with deep emotion. The structure of this message is very important because he starts off just talking about his uncles life and as he moves on there is more emotion and he begins to compare his life 
                to his uncles and more details and feelings are added. This videos structure can help revise my Lived Experiences projects because it showed me that starting out slow and then moving into deep details really helps to get the message across and pulls readers or listeners in.</p>

                <p>The group of people targeted in this video are people that are not very physically active and they play video games all day. It also seemed like they were targeting people that are not very smart. The social issue at hand is that too many kids are sitting inside on the computer or some piece of technology 
                instead of playing outside and getting exercise. Sitting inside looking at a screen all day is very unhealthy and is leading to more obesity issues in children and young adults. In this video they are on the computer the whole time trying to find new ways to get to higher levels in the video game. This video 
                makes being lazy and playing video games look acceptable, here and there they made a few comments about the people playing the video games having no life but overall they are promoting being lazy.</p>

                <p>Chryslers Imported From Detroit Super Bowl ads purpose is to encourage people to buy local and that even though Detroit is struggling buying local, such as Chrysler, is very important for rebuilding our city. The use of imagery in this commercial is very well done. Throughout the ad there are images from various 
                places in Detroit, not only showing the popular downtown but also the factories and some of the abandoned buildings. These images allow for viewers to see the different aspects of the struggling city and how important it is to buy local to help rebuild it. The voice over is also very important because it talks about 
                how Detroit has suffered and how we got back up, and that “where the car is from is as important as who its for.” The purpose of this voice over is to encourage people that buying local is a very important thing. Finally the tagline “Imported From Detroit” portrays the benefit of this company and also allows for viewers 
                to connect on an emotional level. All of these different strategies allow for the effectiveness of the ad.</p>

                <p>During the lived experiences project we had to write about the major we chose and explain why we chose it. Also we had to discuss how a certain technology has had an influence on our decision. I chose to write about a ventilator in a hospital because that piece of technology is very important and has encouraged me to 
                make the decision of going down the medical field path. I have two experiences with a ventilator, the first one is when my cousin Eric had cancer he was put on a ventilator to keep him alive and the second is when I had heart surgery I was intubated and placed on a ventilator to make sure I didn’t stop breathing during surgery. 
                This piece of technology is very important and gives many people a chance to live. I really enjoyed the lived experiences project because it gave me a chance to show my passion for the field I am going in to.</p>

                <p>The cultural analysis project was based off of technology and its affects on society. You could have also chosen a social issue and how technology affects that. I chose the show “Teen Mom” and the teen pregnancy rates in the US. It has been shown that the teen pregnancy rates have decreased since the shows “Teen Mom” and 
                “16 & Pregnant” has aired. These shows show the struggles that teen moms go through in having a baby so young. I believe that this show does help prevent teen pregnancy because it is very heart wrenching watching these mothers struggle with drama, money and education. It is very important for teen moms to pursue their education
                to provide for their child, although many times teen moms do not finish high school.</p>

                <p>Through out the Formal Research Project we had to find research on the importance of technology and research in our field of study. I chose to write about the importance of research, communication and technology in the medical field. I found that all three of those aspects play crucial roles. Research is especially important 
                in the medical field because doctors and researchers are always finding new treatments, cures and diseases. Without research the medical field wouldn’t be able to advance. Technology is also very important in the medical field, it its constantly advancing and making people look at things in a different way. For this project we had 
                to conduct an interview with a person in our field, I chose a friend who is currently in her residency in New York City, New York. I learned a lot during our interview and it made me think of things in a different way that I had previously. I really enjoyed this project because I am very passionate about the medical field and it was 
                really interesting learning about all aspects of it.</p>

                <p>By far our most interactive project was the Remix Documentary Project. During this project we had to collaborate in groups and come up with a social issue to create a documentary about. My group chose the issue of smart phones both the negative and positive affects. I really enjoyed doing this project and I had a great group. The 
                only issue was finding time that everyone could meet. We managed our time very well and made sure that everyone did his or her part in the project. Working in a group makes the load a little lighter because it separates the work up among four people rather than all on one. Working in a group is a very important skill to have and will 
                come in handy in the future. I am thankful that I got the chance to work in a group during this course because I haven’t had any group work yet in college and it is a good skill to have.</p>

                <p>I currently got a new puppy, her name is Beatrice Louise and she is a husky/ lab mix. I got a dog because I live alone and it gets lonely and my parents thought it would be a good idea to have a dog at the house with me. Beatrice has a very bold personality, she loves to chew sticks and go play with the neighbors. Every time the 
                neighbors are outside playing catch or Frisbee she hops the fence to go play. She definitely has more of a husky personality than a lab. Her favorite thing to do is dig, which could be a problem in the spring and summer. We recently found out that she is actually my other dogs half sister, they have the same dad. Beatrice is my whole 
                world and I love her to death, I don’t know where I would be with out her. I am very grateful that my parents allowed me to get a dog because I was having a hard time living alone and adjusting to playing a college sport and balancing classes.</p>
                
                <h>Entry 9</h>
                <p>I am a midfielder on the Michigan State Women’s Lacrosse team. Coming into first semester I was unsure if I was going to play a sport or not but I’m glad I decided to. If I had played lacrosse I wouldn’t have met many people because I am a very shy person. Lacrosse season is from January to April, we also have fall ball, which is 
                September to November. With playing a sport comes a lot of traveling, I was out of town almost every weekend in March and April and it was a very hard adjustment to get used to. In February we traveled to Santa Barbara, California for a huge lacrosse tournament, but unfortunately my school suffered because of lacrosse not being a varsity 
                sport I was not allowed to reschedule my chemistry exam and I had to miss it. This really affected my grade but I am working back up. I am very happy I decided to play lacrosse and I intend on playing next year as well. Being on a team in college, although it’s a club team, is a very good experience and I feel everyone should have a similar 
                experience no matter what club, team, or organization is it.</p>

                <p>This winter has been one of the worst for cold weather and snow all over the country. With wind chill temperatures got down to -30 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas. Attending a school that has such a large campus was difficult during these days. We even got an email warning about the cold weather temperatures and to not have skin exposed 
                to the outside for more than ten minutes but for many of us a walk to class one way is anywhere from five minutes to 40 minutes. It was difficult to brave the cold on these days but we did it. I only gave myself two snow days this semester. Many records were broken this winter such as snowfall and cold temperatures. Many say this winter was an 
                affect of global warming because what happens with global warming is temperatures reach extremes, hot or cold. I am curious to see how the temperatures this summer are and I’m hoping that they are not too hot. This winter was very hard on everyone and every thing, we are slowly recovering from it but will bounce back soon.</p>
                
                <h>Entry 11</h>
                <p>Spring is finally here! Its now April and temperatures are starting to warm up with a few cold days here and there. Now that its warming up there are a lot more people outside hanging out and there’s a lot of music playing. The weekends are a lot louder now that its warm, people are having more parties and going out more. Spring is my 
                favorite season except for all the rain. My birthday is in spring, May 12 to be exact. The spring is a very busy time for me because I’m finishing up school and my lacrosse season. Finals are coming up and the stress load gets heavy but I know I will do well. I am so happy that spring is finally here because that winter was brutal. I finally met 
                my neighbors for the first time but they are graduating soon so they will be moving. When spring starts everyone comes out of hibernation, the bad part about spring is that school ends and everyone goes home for the summer. For some home is far away but others like me, home is close. I will miss all my friends this summer but we are going to have 
                an awesome time in the fall as sophomores.</p>

                <p>Our final project in the class is the Course Retrospect Project in which we write about our experience through out the course. This project was interesting because it allowed us to reflect on our experiences and on what we have learned through out the semester. I realized that I have really strengthened my writing skills and confidence, although 
                they are not up to what I would like them to be they are getting stronger with each paper I write. Included in this paper were reflections on the Lived Experiences project, Cultural Analysis project, Remix project, Github, Codecademy and Blogs. I just explained what each project was and went over a little bit about what I wrote and explained my reasoning 
                behind it. This was a good project to have as a final project because it wasn’t too difficult but it wasn’t easy. I really enjoyed doing this project because it made me think about all the projects I did this semester and allowed me to see my improvement from paper to paper.</p>
