                <p>The purpose of the video was to express the pain that this man and his uncle felt because they were gay and the society they were part of were not accepting leading to the suicide of his unlce. the man then continues to say that he is his uncle, he is living the same life that his uncle lived.
                The video attempted to achieve its purpose by incorporating personal examples and experiences along with deep emotion. The structure of this message is very important because he starts off just talking about his uncles life and as he moves on there is more emotion and he begins to compare his life 
                to his uncles and more details and feelings are added. This videos structure can help revise my Lived Experiences projects because it showed me that starting out slow and then moving into deep details really helps to get the message across and pulls readers or listeners in.</p>
