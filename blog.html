                <h1>Entry 1</h1>
                 <p>The purpose of the video was to express the pain that this man and his uncle felt because they were gay and the society they were part of were not accepting leading to the suicide of his unlce. the man then continues to say that he is his uncle, he is living the same life that his uncle lived.
                The video attempted to achieve its purpose by incorporating personal examples and experiences along with deep emotion. The structure of this message is very important because he starts off just talking about his uncles life and as he moves on there is more emotion and he begins to compare his life 
                to his uncles and more details and feelings are added. This videos structure can help revise my Lived Experiences projects because it showed me that starting out slow and then moving into deep details really helps to get the message across and pulls readers or listeners in.</p>

                <h2>Entry 2</h2>
                <p>The group of people targeted in this video are people that are not very physically active and they play video games all day. It also seemed like they were targeting people that are not very smart. The social issue at hand is that too many kids are sitting inside on the computer or some piece of technology 
                instead of playing outside and getting exercise. Sitting inside looking at a screen all day is very unhealthy and is leading to more obesity issues in children and young adults. In this video they are on the computer the whole time trying to find new ways to get to higher levels in the video game. This video 
                makes being lazy and playing video games look acceptable, here and there they made a few comments about the people playing the video games having no life but overall they are promoting being lazy.</p>

                <h3>Entry 3</h3>
                <p>Chryslers Imported From Detroit Super Bowl ads purpose is to encourage people to buy local and that even though Detroit is struggling buying local, such as Chrysler, is very important for rebuilding our city. The use of imagery in this commercial is very well done. Throughout the ad there are images from various 
                places in Detroit, not only showing the popular downtown but also the factories and some of the abandoned buildings. These images allow for viewers to see the different aspects of the struggling city and how important it is to buy local to help rebuild it. The voice over is also very important because it talks about 
                how Detroit has suffered and how we got back up, and that “where the car is from is as important as who its for.” The purpose of this voice over is to encourage people that buying local is a very important thing. Finally the tagline “Imported From Detroit” portrays the benefit of this company and also allows for viewers 
                to connect on an emotional level. All of these different strategies allow for the effectiveness of the ad.</p>

                <h4>Entry 4</h4>
                <p>During the lived experiences project we had to write about the major we chose and explain why we chose it. Also we had to discuss how a certain technology has had an influence on our decision. I chose to write about a ventilator in a hospital because that piece of technology is very important and has encouraged me to 
                make the decision of going down the medical field path. I have two experiences with a ventilator, the first one is when my cousin Eric had cancer he was put on a ventilator to keep him alive and the second is when I had heart surgery I was intubated and placed on a ventilator to make sure I didn’t stop breathing during surgery. 
                This piece of technology is very important and gives many people a chance to live. I really enjoyed the lived experiences project because it gave me a chance to show my passion for the field I am going in to.</p>

                <h5>Entry 5</h5>
                <p>The cultural analysis project was based off of technology and its affects on society. You could have also chosen a social issue and how technology affects that. I chose the show “Teen Mom” and the teen pregnancy rates in the US. It has been shown that the teen pregnancy rates have decreased since the shows “Teen Mom” and 
                “16 & Pregnant” has aired. These shows show the struggles that teen moms go through in having a baby so young. I believe that this show does help prevent teen pregnancy because it is very heart wrenching watching these mothers struggle with drama, money and education. It is very important for teen moms to pursue their education
                to provide for their child, although many times teen moms do not finish high school.</p>
