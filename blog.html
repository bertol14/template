                <p>content goes here</p>
                <p>The purpose of the video was to express the pain that this man and his uncle felt because they were gay and the society they were part of were not accepting leading to the suicide of his unlce. the man then continues to say that he is his uncle, he is living the same life that his uncle lived.
                The video attempted to achieve its purpose by incorporating personal examples and experiences along with deep emotion. The structure of this message is very important because he starts off just talking about his uncles life and as he moves on there is more emotion and he begins to compare his life 
                to his uncles and more details and feelings are added. This videos structure can help revise my Lived Experiences projects because it showed me that starting out slow and then moving into deep details really helps to get the message across and pulls readers or listeners in.</p>

                <h2>Entry 2</h2>
                <p>The group of people targeted in this video are people that are not very physically active and they play video games all day. It also seemed like they were targeting people that are not very smart. The social issue at hand is that too many kids are sitting inside on the computer or some piece of technology 
                instead of playing outside and getting exercise. Sitting inside looking at a screen all day is very unhealthy and is leading to more obesity issues in children and young adults. In this video they are on the computer the whole time trying to find new ways to get to higher levels in the video game. This video 
                makes being lazy and playing video games look acceptable, here and there they made a few comments about the people playing the video games having no life but overall they are promoting being lazy.</p>
