			<p>After we finished writing our papers we were required to put a web version online on a website called Github. Github allowed us to create our own webpages with the help of templates from the professor. I wasn’t expecting to learn this skill when I signed up for the class but now that I have it I can do all kinds of things when creating my webpage. On our Github not only did we have the papers we had written but we also had blogs that we wrote through out the semester about the class and assignments or even about our day. We also used a website called Codecademy that walked us through creating our own webpage. Codecademy was very helpful when it came to using Github, it provided step by step training on doing just about anything. With the skills I learned in this course I am now able to not only but write and edit codes on websites.
The last portion of our class was blogs. Each day we met we were required to submit a blog, totaling up to fifteen at the end of the semester. In my blogs I wrote about the projects we were working on and also about things in my life. The blogs were repetitive at the time but now looking back I can see what I was doing at that time or how I felt about it. The blogs were not hard but they took a little bit of time to think about what to write and how to write about it thoroughly. Each blog had to be about 200 words and they could be about anything you wanted to write about. I didn’t really enjoy the blogs but I did them.
