			<p>Throughout the years technology has continued advancing rapidly. In the medical field technology is really important because it allows doctors, nurses, etc. to do things that once were difficult and now do them quick and easy.








Figure 1: This figure shows how the advancement of technology over the years has dramatically decreased the amount of deaths. (Thompson, 2012)

Throughout the years there have been many advancements these are just a few to provide an example of the continuous advancement. The constant development of medical technology is shaping the future. Here are just a few examples as to how advances in medical technology benefit people: use of coronary stents, which are artificial turbes used when a patient has coronary heart disease to keep the arteries open, has drastically decreased the amount of people dying from heart failure. Also a Defibrillator has decreased the risk of sudden cardiac death and has a 98% survival chance. Patients having access to accurate blood glucose monitors is helping manage diabetes more effectively. This also allows patients reduce their risk of complications from diabetes such as blindness. (Eucomed 2014). 
	The drive to advance in technology is continuous. Not only does the improvement of medical technology improve the lives of the patients but it also can benefit treatment of diseases that were once difficult. Some of the major technology advances in the medical field were the invention of the x-ray machine, electrocardiograph, ultra sound imaging, CT- scans, PET scans, and MRI’s. Without all of these advances many diagnostics would not be possible today and many lives would be lost. The field that has been affected most by technology is surgery. Technology is very important in surgery because with out the scanning technologies there would not be a guide into the body, or the invention of bypass allows the surgeon to operate on a stopped heart but circulation continues. 
Robotic surgical devices allow a surgeon at a console to operate remote-controlled robotic arms, which may facilitate the performance of laparoscopic procedures. Laparoscopic surgery, in turn, is associated with shorter hospital stays than open surgery, as well as with less postoperative pain and scarring and lower risks of infection and need for blood transfusion. (Barbash & Glied 2010)




Figure 2: this figure shows the increase in number of robotic surgeries over the year (Barbash & Glied 2010)

In the article, Robotic technology in surgery: Past, present, and future written by David B. Camarillo M.S., Thomas M. Krummel M.D., and J. Kenneth Salisbury Jr. Ph.D., the topic of medical robots past, present and future is discussed. The reason for robotic development was to manipulate hazardous items. Unlike in factories, in the operating room “surgical robots can then be viewed as “extending or enhancing human capabilities” rather than replacing humans” because they cannot be programmed to perform a procedure. There are both advantages and disadvantages to medical robots in the operating room. Some of the advantages are: stability and accuracy, repeatability, and manage multiple tasks all at once. A few of the drawbacks of medical robots are: expensive, large, not able to process qualitative information, and not versatile. The article then moves on to talk about how it is essential that there is good communication and understanding surgeons, engineers, entrepreneurs, and health care administrators. There are many different robots used in the operating room today such as the CYberKnife, AESOP, RoboDoc, Acrobot, NeuroMate, and the da Vinci. closing the article is the following statement “Today's medical robots already do work in surprisingly useful ways and yet comprise a technology only in its infancy. We have every reason to believe that the future of robotics in medicine will be full of surprises, and we should be prepared to recognize them and capitalize on the opportunities they provide,” depicts optimism for the future advancements of medical robots. (Camarillo, Krummel & Salisbury 2004).
Along with technology advances comes increased cost of medical care. “Health care costs are increasing at an annual rate of 7% a year, which if sustained will bankrupt Medicare in nine years and increase the nation’s overall annual health care tab to $4 trillion in 10 years.” (Callahan “Framing the Issue”) The continuous rising costs are also increasing the number of uninsured people. From the year 1960 to the year 2006 health expenditures increased by over $2,000. About 50% of annual cost increases are said to be due to new technologies. The hope is that in the future medical care costs will be lower and more accessible for the people who cannot afford it right now. 




Figure 3: this graph shows the increase in cost of health care due to technology over the years. (Callahan “Framing the Issue”)
