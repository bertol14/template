			<p>Teen pregnancy has been an ongoing issue throughout our country during the past few decades. The US has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the western world. There have been many discussions on how to prevent it if that is even possible.  During the last two decades teen pregnancy rates have been declining but they still have a far way to go. The year 2010 had the lowest teen pregnancy rate since the 1940s. “In 2008, nearly 750,000 women younger than 20 became pregnant: Some 733,000 pregnancies were among teenagers (women aged 15–19), and 13,500 were among those aged 14 and younger.” http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/USTPtrends08.pdf. It has been found that teen pregnancy rates vary throughout the different ethnicities; the two ethnicities with the highest rates are Hispanics and African Americans. “Wide differences in birth and abortion rates also persist across racial and ethnic groups. The birthrate in 2008 for black and Hispanic teenagers was more than twice the rate for non-Hispanic white teenagers. The abortion rate among black teenagers was four times the rate for non- Hispanic whites, while the rate among Hispanic teenagers was twice the rate for non-Hispanic white teenagers.” http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/USTPtrends08.pdf In 2009, MTV aired a show called “Teen Mom” which was about teenagers that have had babies and it shows their lives.  Statistics says that over 50 percent of teens have not thought about how pregnancy would affect their lives and the people around them. There has been a lot of dispute of whether “Teen Mom” was glorifying teen pregnancy or whether it was helping prevent it. Research has shown that since the show aired the teen pregnancy rates have decreased more so there is a correlation.</p>
