			<p>“Teen Mom” is an MTV TV show that is on Tuesdays at 10pm, throughout the show four teens are followed after the birth of their child and it shows the struggles not only physically but also mentally and financially. The TV show was a follow up for the MTV show “16 and Pregnant.” There have been many controversies on whether or not the show should be canceled or continued. Both sides of the argument have reasons as to why they feel that way. One side feels the show should be canceled and not aired anymore because it is glorifying teen pregnancy and making teenagers think having a baby at a young age is easy and you can still do everything you want, even though that is not true. The other side believes that continuing to air the show is a good thing and that is depicts the struggles that come along with having a baby at a young age. It has been said that the show may have prevented more than 20,000 births to teenage mothers in 2010. Media is a very influential part of our every day lives whether we know it or not. </p>
