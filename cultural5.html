			<p>There is not a definite solution to teen pregnancy but there are preventative measures that can be taken. One of the most important measures that should be taken to prevent teen pregnancy is more education on sex and contraceptives and abstinence to middle school kids and high school students. Also it would be a good idea to make contraceptives easily accessible and something that is not embarrassing to go get. The importance of abstinence is something that should be reiterated to teens and an explanation of the reasons why it is so important. There are two critical things that could help prevent teenage pregnancy and the first one is “Focus on Effective Prevention Strategies: Adolescents need teen pregnancy prevention strategies and programs that are based on the best, most effective practices as determined by evaluation and research. Effective prevention strategies include: Accurate, balanced, and realistic sexuality education; Youth development; Confidential, low-cost access to contraceptive services. The second part is Continue Support for Needy Families While the federal government should increase its funding to prevent teenage pregnancy, the increased investments should not be achieved by cutting expenditures to support families in need. Because poverty and lack of hope for a productive future are the causes as much as the consequences of adolescent pregnancy, supporting families in need can also be a significant part of the effort to reduce teenage pregnancy and too-early childbearing.” ("Conclusion and Recommendations." Conclusion and Recommendations. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Feb. 2014.) 
	Making condoms and birth control more accessible and educating the importance of them would help reduce teen pregnancy rates. Abstinence is the only 100 percent way to prevent pregnancy. A sexually active teen that does not use contraceptives has a 90 percent chance of becoming pregnant within a year so it is very important to educate on contraceptives.
