			<p>The medical field is continuously evolving, now more than ever. I recently interviewed Dr. Kamash, from Mount Sinai Hospital NY, NY. Kamash attended Wayne State University for medical school and is now in her last year of residency. In our interview we spoke of many aspects of the medical field, one in particular was the influence of research. Kamash stated that “ Research is important in many aspects of the medical field such as academic medicine, drug studies, finding better treatments, finding cures, patient safety and it is especially critical in new things.” From our discussion she emphasized how important research is in the growth of the medical field. Some of the areas she said had the growth most influenced by research were “… medicine is always evolving and there are always new guidelines and research that must be up to date, new guidelines are constantly being made and everyone must be up to date and aware of them.” The next thing we discussed was the importance and roles of writing and reading in the medical field. Dr. Kamash said that “ no matter what level of doctor you are, you are always a student and always learning, reading current journals and articles to learn the latest guidelines for treatment. You are a continuous learner, reading new drug trials and making sure you are up to date on everything. Writing is especially important for documentation because if something is not documented then “it did not happen”. Everything the doctor does and advises to the patient is documented and if something were to go wrong they could go back and see if the doctor did the right thing, and advised the patient to do or not to do something.” Throughout our conversation we touched on varying topics and one that was interesting to me was when we discussed where research is going. Preventative care/ medicine is where the future of research is. Preventative medicine is what one can do to prevent getting a disease instead of having the disease and then providing treatment. From this interview it can be concluded that writing, reading and especially research are all extremely important in all aspects of the medical field.</p>
