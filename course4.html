			<p>The third project we were assigned was the “Formal Research Project”. This project was time consuming but it was also very interesting. For this project we had to explain how technology, communication and research affected our area of study. I chose the medical field and explored the affects of these three components. Research is crucial to the medical field because there are always new cures, diseases and treatments discovered through research. Technology is also very important because it is continuously advancing and new techniques are being discovered to attempt to make things less invasive and easier. Without research and technology, the medical field would not be what it is today. Communication also plays a big role in the medical field. There needs to be good communication not only between doctors but also between doctors and patients. For this project we had to conduct an interview with someone in that field and I chose a friend who is in her third year of residency. I learned a lot of new information from that interview and it allowed me to look at things from a different perspective. Although this project was the most time consuming it was very informative and exposed us to the research paper style of writing.</p>
