			<p>The next project we did was the “Remix” project. This project was a lot of fun to do. We were put into groups and we had to choose a social issue that has to do with technology and create a documentary on it. My group chose to look at the positive and negative affects of smart phones. We found that there is an actual thing as smartphone addiction; this is mainly common in China. I got really lucky and was placed in a great group for this project; we all got along great and worked very well together. The only issue with this project was time, I play women’s lacrosse for MSU and we did this project in the middle of my season so it was difficult for me to find time to meet with my group but we made it work. This project is very important because there are many things that you are learning. One main one is learning how to work in a group and share ideas. I believe that everyone should experience working in a group at some point, it may be frustrating at times but it is a very good skill to have.</p>
