		<p> Throughout this project I learned a lot of things that I did not know about. By doing research it allowed me to understand the issue that our documentary focused on. Smartphones have become such a big part of our daily lives and many people do not know the negative side effects of them. This was very important to me because I am also an avid smartphone user, now knowing these side effects I am going to change the way I use my phone.</p>
		<p2> This topic was selected because it was really interesting to our whole group and it was a topic that had a lot of controversy and facts to back it up.  The use of smartphones has become a big issue in our society today. There are both positive and negative aspects of this piece of technology. The most challenging part of the project was finding time in my busy schedule to meet with my group and make sure I’m doing my share of the project. I have 16 credits and play lacrosse for MSU so I have a very busy schedule but fortunately I was able to find times that I could meet with my group.
		</p2>
		<p3> My group worked really well together and we all put in a lot of effort. Everyone did their job and did it well. There were no arguments or people slacking off which made this group project a really good experience. Working in a group is good and bad, the good side is that the work is spread out among multiple people, not putting too much on one person and bad side is that there has to be group meetings that fit everyone’s busy schedule. It was very hard for me to find time to meet with my group due to school and lacrosse but I was able to find times that worked for everyone. </p3>
		<p4> I planned my work on this project pretty well for the most part. We had multiple meetings where we discussed how we were going to go about things. At these meetings we discussed what the design was going to be, made a script and then assigned equal parts to each person. We then had a week gap before our last meeting where we each did all of our parts and at the final meeting we put everything together. If I were to do it over again and had more time I would add more video clips and less pictures to go along with the talking. Due to time and struggle to find a video camera we decided that using pictures would best benefit our documentary.</p4>
		<p5> The most effective aspect of our documentary design is the information that we are talking about. The information was most important because it displays many negative facts and statistics that are a part of everyday life with smartphones. We chose to design our documentary the way we did because it allowed us to piece all of our parts together in a easy way and allowed it to flow.</p5>
		<p6> I really enjoyed doing this group project. I thought it was a great experience and I really liked my group members. Working in a group is a very important skill that everyone should have. All in all I think our documentary group project went very well and I would love to work with my group members again.</p6>
