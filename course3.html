			<p>After the “Lived Experiences” assignment we did the “Cultural Analysis” project. This project was really interesting to do because we had to look at a social issue and discuss how technology has affected it. For my paper I chose the issue of teen pregnancy and how MTV’s show Teen Mom has affected the rates. Through out my paper I discussed how the teen pregnancy rates have decreased since Teen Mom has been on TV, its unknown if it is directly related to the show but it has been shown statistically that the teen pregnancy rate has decreased. The show is criticized often, in my opinion it shows the true struggles not only financially but also physically and mentally of having a child at such a young age. Many people say that Teen Mom glorifies teen pregnancy but I do not believe that; watching those girls struggle, most of the time with out the babys father around, does not look appealing and makes me not want to have a baby at a young age. I really enjoyed this writing style and doing this project.</p>
