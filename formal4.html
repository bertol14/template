			<p>Communication is the foundation to the medical field and is necessary for high quality patient care. It has been said that the leading cause of patient harm is miscommunication. “Many factors contribute to communication failures. First and foremost, doctors and nurses are trained to communicate differently.” (Leonard, Graham & Bonagum 2004). The application of knowledge is not anymore important than how we communicate it. The relay of information must attempt to meet the patients’ expectations and establish a rapport at the same time.it is crucial for doctors to ensure that they inform and teach their patients about their condition in a manner that is understandable; they do so by making analogies of complex medical concepts. Bad communication can cause a patient to be fearful, and change the patient’s experience of the disease. There are some difficulties when it comes to communication, there can be barriers that can affect it negatively and the only way to overcome it requires persistent effort. The improvement of communication can strengthen relationships between colleagues and most importantly improve patient care outcomes. In order to avoid harm to the patient doctors there needs to be strong communication between everyone on the team and the patient.</p>
			<p> In a trade article written by Leonard, Graham and Bonacum, the importance of effective communication and teamwork is discussed in order to provide high quality patient care. Debriefing is critical, it is when you spend a couple minutes at the end of the day to discuss what went well and what needs to be worked on and how it can be fixed. It is one of the key success factors in the surgical unit. “Wrong site surgeries, which had been a problem in the past, have not occurred since the briefing process has been initiated.” (Leonard, Graham & Bonacum 2004). Effective teamwork and communication can prevent harm to patients and providers. The assertion cycle is a model to guide and improve assertion with the interest of patient safety: Get persons attention→ Express concern→ state problem→propose action→ reach a decision→back to “get persons attention”. A briefing chart shows potential topics for discussion among the surgical team and is very important to keep track of everything that needs to be discussed. Communication is key in keeping everyone on the same page and also in preventing something from going wrong.</p>
