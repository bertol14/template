			<p>Research, which is the study of materials and sources to establish facts and find new conclusions, is an especially important part of the medical field. The reason people do research is because they have ideas and theories that they want to share with the rest of the world. Through this the challenges and benefits can be discussed and more thoroughly understood. Research allows for the science and medical communities from all around the world to be brought together and to educate one another. There is such thing as Evidence Based Medicine (EBM), which is, evidence based on research that establishes guidelines for all doctors to abide by. This EBM is the basic guidelines that doctors must follow and there is evidence behind every guideline to back it up. Innovative people are the ones who contribute to “forward” thinking; such people are the researchers, doctor and scientists with passion and commitment to discovering these new findings and providing evidence to support them. Without these passionate people the system itself would not be able to operate.</p>
